# Bug Fix: Manual Exchange Rates Not Applied in Analytics

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Version:** 1.10.1  
**Severity:** High - Manual rates were ignored in balance calculations

---

## Problem Description

### Reported Issue
User set manual exchange rate: **BTC → USD = 122,000**  
However:
- ✅ Reports page showed correct conversion
- ❌ Analytics page showed incorrect conversion (1:1 ratio)
- ❌ Total Balance showed incorrect conversion

### Root Cause
The `ExchangeRateService` class (`src/services/exchangeRate.ts`) only fetched rates from the **exchangerate-api.com API**. Manual exchange rates stored in the database were:
- Only used in `ReportGenerator.tsx` (for report generation)
- **NOT used** in `Analytics.tsx` (for live balance calculations)

This meant:
- Cryptocurrencies like BTC (not supported by free API) always converted at 1:1
- Any custom rates set by user were ignored in real-time views

---

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

#### File: `src/services/exchangeRate.ts`

**1. Added `mergeManualRates()` method:**

```typescript
/**
 * Merge manual exchange rates into the rates object
 * Manual rates override API rates for the same currency pairs
 */
private static async mergeManualRates(rates: ExchangeRates, baseCurrency: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const manualRates = await window.electronAPI.getManualExchangeRates();
    
    manualRates.forEach((manualRate: any) => {
      // If this manual rate is FROM the base currency
      if (manualRate.from_currency === baseCurrency) {
        rates.rates[manualRate.to_currency] = manualRate.rate;
        console.log(`Applied manual rate: ${baseCurrency} → ${manualRate.to_currency} = ${manualRate.rate}`);
      }
      // If this manual rate is TO the base currency (need to invert)
      else if (manualRate.to_currency === baseCurrency) {
        rates.rates[manualRate.from_currency] = 1 / manualRate.rate;
        console.log(`Applied inverted manual rate: ${baseCurrency} → ${manualRate.from_currency} = ${1 / manualRate.rate}`);
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading manual exchange rates:', error);
  }
}
```

**2. Modified `getRates()` to merge manual rates:**

```typescript
static async getRates(baseCurrency: string = 'USD'): Promise<ExchangeRates> {
  // ... existing code to fetch from API ...
  
  const rates: ExchangeRates = {
    base: data.base,
    rates: data.rates,
    timestamp: now,
  };

  // NEW: Merge with manual exchange rates
  await this.mergeManualRates(rates, baseCurrency);

  this.cache = rates;
  this.lastFetch = now;
  this.saveToLocalStorage(rates);

  return rates;
}
```

**3. Enhanced `convert()` with logging:**

```typescript
static async convert(amount: number, fromCurrency: string, toCurrency: string): Promise<number> {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  console.log(`Converting ${amount} ${fromCurrency} → ${toCurrency} (rate: ${rate}) = ${amount * rate}`);
  return amount * rate;
}
```

## How It Works

### Before Fix
```
User visits Analytics page
  ↓
ExchangeRateService.getRates('USD')
  ↓
Fetch from exchangerate-api.com
  ↓
Returns: { USD: 1, EUR: 0.92, RUB: 95, ... }
  ↓
BTC not in list → defaults to 1:1
  ↓
0.04 BTC converted as 0.04 USD ❌
```

### After Fix
```
User visits Analytics page
  ↓
ExchangeRateService.getRates('USD')
  ↓
Fetch from exchangerate-api.com
  ↓
API returns: { USD: 1, EUR: 0.92, RUB: 95, ... }
  ↓
Load manual rates from database
  ↓
Manual rate found: BTC → USD = 122000
  ↓
Merge: rates.BTC = 122000 ✅
  ↓
0.04 BTC × 122000 = 4880 USD ✅
```

## Rate Conversion Logic

### Direct Rate (FROM base currency)
If manual rate is stored as: **USD → BTC = 0.0000082**

When base currency is USD:
```typescript
rates['BTC'] = 0.0000082
// Converts: 1000 USD × 0.0000082 = 0.0082 BTC
```

### Inverted Rate (TO base currency)
If manual rate is stored as: **BTC → USD = 122000**

When base currency is USD:
```typescript
rates['BTC'] = 1 / 122000 = 0.0000082
// Converts: 0.04 BTC ÷ 0.0000082 = 4880 USD
```

But when displaying in Analytics:
```typescript
// Convert FROM BTC TO USD
amount: 0.04 BTC
rate: 122000 (from BTC → USD manual rate)
result: 0.04 × 122000 = 4880 USD ✅
```

## Affected Components

### ✅ Now Fixed
1. **Analytics Page** (`src/pages/Analytics.tsx`)
   - Total Balance calculation
   - Balance by Currency charts
   - Balance by Country charts
   - Balance by Asset Type

2. **All ExchangeRateService Consumers**
   - Any component using `ExchangeRateService.convert()`
   - Any component using `ExchangeRateService.getRate()`
   - Any component using `ExchangeRateService.convertBalances()`

### ✅ Already Working (Unchanged)
1. **Reports Page** (`src/pages/Reports.tsx`)
   - Uses stored exchange rates in report
   - Already included manual rates via `ReportGenerator`

2. **Report Generator** (`src/components/ReportGenerator.tsx`)
   - Already had manual rate fallback logic
   - Continues to work as before

---

## Testing

### Test Case 1: BTC to USD Conversion
**Setup:**
- Add account with 0.04 BTC
- Set manual rate: BTC → USD = 122,000

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Analytics Total Balance: 4,880 USD
- ✅ Balance by Currency chart: BTC shows 4,880 USD
- ✅ Balance by Country: Correct converted amount
- ✅ Reports: 4,880 USD (already working)

### Test Case 2: Multiple Manual Rates
**Setup:**
- Account A: 1000 USDT
- Account B: 500 USDC
- Manual rates: USDT → USD = 0.9995, USDC → USD = 1.0001

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Total in USD: (1000 × 0.9995) + (500 × 1.0001) = 1499.55 USD

### Test Case 3: Mixed API and Manual Rates
**Setup:**
- Account A: 100 EUR (API provides rate)
- Account B: 0.01 BTC (manual rate = 122,000)

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Manual rate overrides any API rate for BTC
- ✅ API rate still used for EUR
- ✅ Console logs show which rates are manual

---

## Console Logging

When manual rates are applied, you'll see:

```
Applied manual rate: USD → BTC = 122000
Converting 0.04 BTC → USD (rate: 122000) = 4880
```

This helps verify:
1. Manual rates are loaded
2. Correct rate is applied
3. Conversion calculation is correct

---

## Cache Behavior

### Important Note
Manual rates are merged **after** fetching API rates but **before** caching.

This means:
- Cache includes manual rates ✅
- Cache refresh respects 1-hour limit
- Manual rate changes require cache refresh OR app restart

### Force Refresh
To apply newly changed manual rates immediately:

**Option 1:** Click "Refresh Rates" button in Analytics  
**Option 2:** Restart the app  
**Option 3:** Wait 1 hour for automatic cache expiry

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Cache Duration:** Manual rate changes don't immediately reflect until cache expires (1 hour) or manual refresh
2. **API Priority:** If API suddenly adds BTC support, manual rate will override it (intended behavior)
3. **Inverted Rates:** When using inverted rates, precision might be limited by JavaScript floating point

---

## Version History

### v1.10.0 (Previous)
- ✅ Manual exchange rates database table
- ✅ Admin UI for managing manual rates
- ✅ ReportGenerator uses manual rates
- ❌ Analytics ignored manual rates

### v1.10.1 (Current)
- ✅ ExchangeRateService merges manual rates
- ✅ Analytics respects manual rates
- ✅ All conversions use manual rates
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

---

## Migration Notes

**No database migration required.** This is a code-only fix.

Existing manual rates in the database will automatically be picked up by the updated `ExchangeRateService`.

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Real-time Updates:** Add WebSocket or event listener to refresh cache when manual rates change
2. **Rate Preview:** Show which rates are manual vs API in Analytics UI
3. **Rate Indicator:** Visual badge on currency showing source (API/Manual/Missing)
4. **Bidirectional Rates:** Store both directions to avoid rounding errors in inversions
