# ✅ YOUR APP IS RUNNING!

## What Just Happened

We successfully fixed two issues:

### 1. ✅ Native Module Compatibility (FIXED)
**Problem**: `better-sqlite3` was compiled for Node.js v22, but Electron uses Node.js v18 internally.

**Solution**: We rebuilt the module for Electron:
```powershell
npx electron-rebuild
```

This is now automatic - whenever you run `npm install`, the modules are rebuilt.

### 2. ✅ Development Server Connection (FIXED)
**Problem**: Electron couldn't find the Vite development server.

**Solution**: 
- Added `cross-env` to properly set environment variables
- Updated Electron to try multiple ports (5173, 5174)
- Added a small delay to let Vite start first

## 🎉 Current Status

Your app should be running now! You should see:

1. **Terminal output** showing:
   ```
   VITE v5.4.20  ready in XXX ms
   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5174/
   ```

2. **Electron window** opening with your Budget Manager app

## 📋 Available Commands

### Development
```powershell
# Easy way (cleans ports first)
. .\start-dev-clean.ps1

# Or manually
. .\setup-path.ps1
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production
```powershell
. .\setup-path.ps1
npm run build
npm run package:win
```

The installer will be in `release/` folder.

### Rebuilding Native Modules
If you ever get module version errors again:
```powershell
. .\setup-path.ps1
npm run rebuild
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Not Problems, Just FYI)

### Deprecation Warnings
You'll see warnings like:
- `util._extend API is deprecated` 
- `Vite CJS build is deprecated`

**These are harmless** - they're from dependencies, not your code. They won't affect functionality.

### Port Changes
If port 5173 is busy, Vite uses 5174. The app handles both automatically.

### NODE_ENV Warning
You might see `NODE_ENV` not defined in some tools. This is normal and doesn't affect the app.

## 🔧 If the Window Doesn't Open

1. **Check terminal** - Look for errors after "electron ."
2. **Wait 2-3 seconds** - There's a delay to let Vite start
3. **Try manually** - Open http://localhost:5174 in a browser to test Vite
4. **Restart** - Press Ctrl+C, then run `npm run dev` again

## 💡 Development Tips

### Hot Reload
- Changes to React files (src/) reload automatically
- Changes to Electron files (electron/) require restart
- Press **Ctrl+C** to stop, then run `npm run dev` again

### Developer Tools
- Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
- Check Console for errors
- Use React DevTools (install as browser extension)

### Database Location
Your data is stored at:
```
C:\Users\atyurina\AppData\Roaming\budget-app\
  ├── budget.db      (your database)
  └── .key           (encryption key - BACK THIS UP!)
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **✅ App is running** - You should see it now
2. **Set up your data** - Add countries, currencies, accounts
3. **Start budgeting** - Add transactions
4. **Explore analytics** - See your financial insights

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to dev server"
- Check if Vite started (look for "VITE vX.X.X ready")
- Try accessing http://localhost:5174 directly
- Restart: Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`

### "Module version mismatch"
```powershell
. .\setup-path.ps1
npm run rebuild
```

### "Port already in use"
```powershell
. .\start-dev-clean.ps1
```
This cleans ports before starting.

### "Node/npm not found"
```powershell
. .\setup-path.ps1
```
Run this in every new terminal.
